# SpawnDev.BlazorJS.THREE
Use the [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) 3D library in Blazor WebAssembly. SpawnDev.BlazorJS.THREE uses [SpawnDev.BlazorJS](https://github.com/LostBeard/SpawnDev.BlazorJS) for Javascript interop. [JSObjects](https://github.com/LostBeard/SpawnDev.BlazorJS?tab=readme-ov-file#jsobject-base-class) are used to wrap Three.js classes.

This project was largely auto-generated using Three.js TypeScript Declarations GitHub repo: [three-types/three-ts-types](https://github.com/three-types/three-ts-types), 
and then filled in enough to get the current demos running. 

[Demo Web App](https://lostbeard.github.io/SpawnDev.BlazorJS.THREE/)
- [Basic Demo](https://lostbeard.github.io/SpawnDev.BlazorJS.THREE/) - Draws a 3D spinning cube
- [AR Cube Demo](https://lostbeard.github.io/SpawnDev.BlazorJS.THREE/ARCubeDemo) - Draws a 3D spinning cube using WebXR `immersive-ar` mode. (Quest 3 tested.)
